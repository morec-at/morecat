This system will support modern headless architecture principles while providing intuitive content authoring capabilities for non-technical users. The CMS will serve as the foundation for scalable content operations, supporting omnichannel delivery and AI-powered content optimization.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature aligns with the goal of creating a flexible, scalable content platform that can adapt to evolving digital touchpoints. The CMS supports the product vision by enabling content creators to work efficiently while providing developers with the tools needed for modern web experiences, including API-first architecture and seamless integrations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1 - Content Creation and Management\n\n**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create and edit content through an intuitive interface, so that I can produce engaging content without technical barriers.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user accesses the content editor THEN the system SHALL provide a visual editing interface with WYSIWYG capabilities\n2. WHEN a user creates content THEN the system SHALL support rich media including images, videos, and embedded content\n3. WHEN a user saves content THEN the system SHALL auto-save drafts and provide version history\n4. WHEN a user publishes content THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and content structure\n\n### Requirement 2 - Headless Content Delivery\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access content through APIs, so that I can deliver content to multiple platforms and applications.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN content is published THEN the system SHALL expose it via RESTful APIs\n2. WHEN an API request is made THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON data with proper schema\n3. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates through webhooks\n4. WHEN filtering content THEN the system SHALL support query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination\n\n### Requirement 3 - Content Structure and Modeling\n\n**User Story:** As a content architect, I want to define flexible content types, so that I can structure content according to business needs.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN defining content types THEN the system SHALL support custom field definitions\n2. WHEN creating field types THEN the system SHALL provide text, rich text, media, relationships, and custom field types\n3. WHEN modeling relationships THEN the system SHALL support one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships\n4. WHEN validating content THEN the system SHALL enforce field requirements and data types\n\n### Requirement 4 - Multi-language Support\n\n**User Story:** As a global content manager, I want to create content in multiple languages, so that I can serve international audiences.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN creating content THEN the system SHALL support multiple language versions\n2. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL maintain content structure across translations\n3. WHEN publishing multilingual content THEN the system SHALL provide language-specific API endpoints\n4. WHEN managing translations THEN the system SHALL track translation status and completeness\n\n### Requirement 5 - Media Management\n\n**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to manage digital assets efficiently, so that I can incorporate media into my content seamlessly.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN uploading media THEN the system SHALL support multiple file formats (images, videos, documents)\n2. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL provide automatic optimization and multiple format generation\n3. WHEN organizing media THEN the system SHALL support folders, tags, and metadata\n4. WHEN delivering media THEN the system SHALL provide CDN-optimized URLs with appropriate caching headers\n\n### Requirement 6 - User Roles and Permissions\n\n**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to control access to content and features, so that I can maintain security and workflow integrity.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL support role-based access control\n2. WHEN defining permissions THEN the system SHALL allow granular control over content types and operations\n3. WHEN content requires approval THEN the system SHALL support workflow states (draft, review, published)\n4. WHEN auditing actions THEN the system SHALL log all content changes with user attribution\n\n### Requirement 7 - Search and Filtering\n\n**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to find content quickly, so that I can efficiently manage large content repositories.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN searching content THEN the system SHALL provide full-text search capabilities\n2. WHEN filtering content THEN the system SHALL support filtering by content type, author, status, and dates\n3. WHEN browsing content THEN the system SHALL provide sortable column views\n4. WHEN searching across languages THEN the system SHALL support language-specific search\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each CMS module should have a single, well-defined purpose (content creation, API delivery, media management)\n- **Modular Design**: Content types, field types, and delivery mechanisms should be isolated and reusable\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between content management and content delivery layers\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between CMS backend, APIs, and frontend applications\n\n### Performance\n- API responses must return within 200ms for standard content queries\n- Content delivery should support caching with appropriate cache headers\n- Image optimization should provide multiple format outputs (WebP, AVIF, JPEG)\n- Database queries should be optimized with proper indexing for search operations\n\n### Security\n- All API endpoints must implement authentication and authorization\n- Content input must be sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks\n- Media uploads must be validated for file type and size limitations\n- User sessions must be securely managed with appropriate timeout policies\n\n### Reliability\n- Content APIs should maintain 99.9% uptime\n- Data backup and recovery procedures must be implemented\n- Version control should prevent content loss during editing conflicts\n- Error handling should provide meaningful feedback to users\n\n### Usability\n- Content creation interface should be intuitive for non-technical users\n- Rich text editor should support common formatting without HTML knowledge\n- Media management should support drag-and-drop functionality\n- Content preview should accurately represent published appearance",
